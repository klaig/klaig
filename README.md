## Featured Project

### SDA Travel Agency: Full-Stack Application
- **Front-end Repo**: [SDA Travel agency frontend](https://github.com/klaig/SDATravelAgencyFrontend)
- **Back-end Repo**: [SDA Travel agency backend](https://github.com/klaig/SDATravelAgencyBackend)
  
The SDA Travel Agency app is a robust, full-stack web application I developed using Java, Spring, Hibernate, and Angular.  
This platform is designed to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for travelers looking to browse, filter, and book tours.  
For admins, it's equipped with a comprehensive set of tools to create, modify, and manage tour offerings easily.

Key Features:
- Tour Browsing & Booking: Users can explore a variety of tours, get detailed information, and make bookings effortlessly.
- Admin Management: A secure and intuitive admin panel for managing tour listings, user data, and more.

Every aspect of this project, from the responsive front-end design to the efficient back-end services, showcases my commitment to building practical and engaging web solutions. Look at the READMEs for more info.

## My Passion for Programming
Iâ€™m absolutely fascinated by the world of programming â€” the process of solving complex problems and bringing ideas to life step-by-step is incredibly rewarding for me. Each project, whether big or small, is a new adventure, filled with learning and growth.  
I have a clear goal in sight: to evolve into a seasoned and skilled senior software developer. This ambition drives me to delve deeper into the tech world, continuously expand my skill set, and embrace every opportunity to learn and contribute in meaningful ways.
